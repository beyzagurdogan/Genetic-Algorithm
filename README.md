Genetic Algorithm for Traveling Salesman Problem
This project implements a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Genetic algorithms are optimization techniques inspired by natural selection.

Features
Random initial population generation

Selection, crossover, and mutation operators for evolution

Optimization over generations to find the shortest route

Visualization of the evolving solution
